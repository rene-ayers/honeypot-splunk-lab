# Honeypot-Splunk-Lab  

Honeypot (Cowrie) with Splunk Enterprise for log monitoring and network traffic analysis in a VMware lab environment.  

---

## Project Overview  

- Deploy a **Cowrie honeypot** to simulate vulnerable services  
- Capture malicious activity directed at the honeypot  
- Forward logs into **Splunk Enterprise** for real-time monitoring and detection  
- Build dashboards and alerts to analyze attacker behavior  

ðŸ‘‰ The goal is to show how a honeypot integrates with a SIEM for hands-on **security monitoring and threat analysis**.  

---

## Technologies Used  

- **VMware Workstation Pro** â€“ Virtualized lab environment  
- **pfSense** â€“ Firewall and NAT port forwarding  
- **Ubuntu** â€“ Honeypot and Splunk host  
- **Cowrie Honeypot** â€“ SSH/Telnet emulation  
- **Docker** â€“ Containerized Splunk Enterprise deployment  
- **Splunk Enterprise** â€“ Log collection, parsing, dashboards, and alerting
